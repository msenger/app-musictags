* All songs in an album have the same album name.

* If more artists:
  a) We may change it to one, or
  b) We need to set the TCMP to 1.

* Can be more artist tags for the same song?

* Normalize of the artist's name?

* Tracks:
  - missing?
  - 2-digits long?

* What to do with AlbumArtist?
  - set it from artists?
  - remove it completely?

* What is in comments? Remove them?

* Invalid ID3v2 tag - what to do with them?

* Wide characters in print

  Perhaps: binmode STDOUT, ":utf8"; - but only for STDOUT, for
  updating MP3 files I think to use just the binmode?

* et al.
  - means: et alii
           [Latin: and others]

* currently: the albums with just 1 piece are ignored

* the tag names may be different for wma
  (see http://help.mp3tag.de/main_tags.html)
